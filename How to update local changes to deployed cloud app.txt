To implement changes in your files, **rebuild the Docker image**, and deploy the updated image to **Azure Container Apps**, youâ€™ll follow these steps:

---

### ðŸ”„ Step-by-step Process

#### 1. **Make Changes Locally**

- Modify the files in your local development environment (Flask app, templates, Dockerfile, etc.).
  
---

#### 2. **Rebuild the Docker Image**

After youâ€™ve made your changes, rebuild the Docker image using the same **`docker build`** command, which will automatically include all your new changes:

```bash
docker build -t yourusername/your-app-name .
```

This will rebuild the Docker image locally with all your updated code. The tag (`yourusername/your-app-name`) should match the name you used when pushing the image to Docker Hub earlier.

---

#### 3. **Push the New Image to Docker Hub (or other container registry)**

Once the image is built, push it to **Docker Hub** or whichever container registry you are using (if itâ€™s private, make sure youâ€™re logged in).

```bash
docker push yourusername/your-app-name
```

This will upload the newly built image to Docker Hub (or your chosen container registry). Make sure it uses the same tag (`yourusername/your-app-name`) as before so Azure knows to pull the updated image.

---

#### 4. **Update Azure Container App**

Now that your new Docker image is pushed to Docker Hub, you can update the Azure Container App to use the latest image.

You can either use the **Azure Portal**, **Azure CLI**, or **Bicep/ARM** templates. Hereâ€™s how to do it via Azure CLI:

```bash
az containerapp update \
  --name my-portfolio-app \
  --resource-group my-portfolio-rg \
  --image yourusername/your-app-name
```

This command will tell Azure to pull the latest Docker image from Docker Hub (or your container registry) and replace the currently running container with the new one.

---

#### 5. **Confirm the Update**

Once the image is updated, you can confirm by:

1. Visiting the app via your custom domain.
2. Checking the **Azure Portal** under your **Container App** > **Logs** to see the most recent activity or errors (if any).

---

### ðŸ“¢ **Additional Tip**:

If youâ€™re deploying **multiple updates** in the future, you can tag the Docker image with **versioning** for better management, e.g.,

```bash
docker build -t yourusername/your-app-name:v2 .
docker push yourusername/your-app-name:v2
```

Then, update your Azure Container App to pull the new version:

```bash
az containerapp update \
  --name my-portfolio-app \
  --resource-group my-portfolio-rg \
  --image yourusername/your-app-name:v2
```

** MAKE SURE TO REPLACE THE PLACEHOLDER with actual name IN THE BASH CODE **
